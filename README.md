# Hawaiian-Pizza

Pizza is a yeasted flatbread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments, such as cheese. Mozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples. Today, other cheeses have been used as pizza ingredients, including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Hawaiian pizza is topped with Canadian Bacon and pineapple.
